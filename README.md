# Linot ‚Äî Real-Time Whot on Linera Microchains

> A lightning-fast, blockchain-powered card game built on **Linera microchains**.  
> Linot combines nostalgic gameplay with real-time betting to show what **low-latency blockchain gaming** can truly feel like.

---

##  Overview

**Linot** is a multiplayer Whot-style card game built on Linera‚Äôs microchain architecture.  
It reimagines the classic African card game we grew up playing ‚Äî but this time, every move happens **on-chain**, instantly.

Players can challenge friends, join tournaments, or spectate live matches.  
Spectators can even **bet on matches in real time**, with odds that update dynamically as the game progresses.

###  What We‚Äôre Proving

> Real-time, on-chain gaming *is possible* ‚Äî with the right infrastructure.

Most blockchain games are slow because transactions wait in queues.  
With Linera‚Äôs **parallel microchains**, every match gets its own chain.  
That means **sub-second latency**, no congestion, and gameplay that feels like Web2.

##  Core Concept

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
|  **Gameplay** | Fast, familiar Whot-style strategy game with action cards |
| ‚ö° **Microchain per Match** | Each match runs on its own microchain ‚Äî zero lag, no interference |
|  **Prediction Market Layer** | Spectators place live bets; odds adjust dynamically via an on-chain pool |
|  **Manual Reward Distribution** | Winners and top players are recorded on-chain, with rewards manually handled during the early phase |
|  **Web2 Feel, Web3 Power** | GraphQL subscriptions + Linera‚Äôs instant state updates |

##  Gameplay Loop

1. **Match Creation:**  
   A player creates a match ‚Üí Linera spawns a dedicated microchain instance.

2. **Join & Sync:**  
   2‚Äì4 players join. Game state syncs instantly through Linera‚Äôs low-latency channels.

3. **Real-Time Play:**  
   Each move is recorded on-chain and confirmed in milliseconds.

4. **Spectator Betting:**  
   Spectators view live matches and bet on the winner. Odds adjust automatically.

5. **End of Match:**  
   Results finalize instantly; winnings or recognition handled manually for now.
